# Password Leet Generation - Working Goal

1. The user can enter sentence phrases that are as long as a password length (including spaces) and we can convert those into passwords that have randomly added but memorable special characters (like replacing L with 1, a with @, v with 3, etc), so that passwords like Humb13P1e can be easily generated.
2. Secondary function is where the user can generate such a memorable password easily, ex. M@rti@lPr0w3ss while specifying how many special characters the password needs, how many uppercase, lowercase, numbers, password length, etc, using a set of dropdowns, or radio buttons etc.
3. There can be specifiers to replace characters with less complex or more complex character iterations as well as a selection on what character you want to replace the space between passwords to (either select from a dropdown or pick any character you want).
